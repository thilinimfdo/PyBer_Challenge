Ride sharing per city type

Overview

This report is presenting a report on understanding the difference between rides and shares between different city types and how these differences can be used to make decisions at PyBer.

Analysis

- As per the following graph it is clear that the per ride share is significantly higher compared to suburban and urban. However, the number of rides in rural areas are significantly lower compared to suburban and urban. This is expected given the adoption and population is lower in rural areas, they expected to have fewer rides compared to urban (or suburban).

- The line graph shows the variation of total fares by city type. Even though rural cities have higher fare by ride due to the increased number of rides in urbans, the total number of fares accumulated across rides, urban cities have the highest total fares. The variation across cities is quite similar across the analyzed cities.

Recommendations 

The two diagrams show a clear picture. Rural has the highest fares per ride but lacks the volume hence urban rides with lowest fare per ride bring the higher total revenue for the organization. There are no clear variation between weeks of the observed period.
